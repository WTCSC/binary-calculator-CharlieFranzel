Binary Calculator!

-- This can add, subtrack, multiply and devide 8-bit binary numbers

-- Includes error handling for invalid input as well as overflow numbers and dividing by zero

-- Code is seperated into 4 primary functions
    - Error checking which checks for invalid input
    - Binary decoding, turns binary into a decimal
    - Binary encoding, turns decimal into a binary

-- Works by taking the inputs and running them through the error checker, then converts them to decimal, does the calculation and finally converts back to binary
